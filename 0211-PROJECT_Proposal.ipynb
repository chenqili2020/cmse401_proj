    "- **Milestone 2: Software Exploration** - You will explore software NOT covered in this course. Software may include a library, programming language, hardware, scientific code, etc).  The project will require you to learn about the software, get it installed and working on the HPC (or equivalent) and write up a short tutorial with examples with enough details so that your peers can get it up and running).  See [0325-PROJECT_Part1](0325-PROJECT_Part1.ipynb) for more information.\n",
    "- **Milestone 3: Benchmark and Optimization** - You will identify an existing scientific/engineering problem that currently runs slow.  You will either write a new program form scratch or modify an existing code to run in parallel.  You may also modify an existing parallel code to run in parallel faster.   You may, but are not required to use the software you explored in milestone 2 of the project. See [0415-PROJECT_Part2](0415-PROJECT_Part2.ipynb) for more information.\n",

    "## What not to include (building a .gitignore file)\n",
    "\n",
    "First thing we want to teach is is that not everything should go into a git repository.  i.e. we do not want to bloat our repository with unwanted files.  The git repository works best with Text files that represent \"source\" code and not compiled or generated code. Here are some basic guidelines of what not to include:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```.ipynb_checkpoint``` - These folders are generated when you run jupyter notebooks.  They are \"temporary\" compiled folders that will change each time you run your notebook and should not be included in your repository. \n",
    "* ```__pychache__``` - Similar to .ipynb_checkpoint folders these folders are often generated when running python scripts and should not be included in your repository. \n",
    "* **_Other \"Temporary\" files_** - Temporary files are generated by all types of software and often start with a special characters such as the dot (.) or the tilde (~).  For example many text editors generate temporary files to save a document in case of a program crash.  Do not include temporary files in your repository. \n",
    "* **_Compiled Code_** - Programs such as C and FORTRAN must compile their code to an executable in order to run on your computer. These compiled codes are not editable and should be left out of your repository.  Instead it is better to include instructions for compiling the source code as part of your repository.  \n",
    "* **_Program Output_** - Do not include any program output in your repository (unless for very specific reasons such as documentation, testing, or figures in your final report).  Assume that any output that can be generated by the source code should not be included with the source code (it is redundant). \n",
    "\n",
    "A good rule of thumb is that if you did not generate the file and/or do not know what it is you probably do NOT want to include it in your repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "**_WARNING_** do not blindly add all files to your repository with the * (star) syntax.  This is bad practice. For example do NOT do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git add * #THIS IS BAD!!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other files to avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the above files it is good to avoid any type of \"Binary\" file (with a few exceptions).  As stated early, git works best with text files so it can easily track changes. Some example binary files to avoid include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **_Large Data files_**  Although it is good to include a few example inputs to your software, avoid using entire datasets.  It is best to store these files someplace else.  \n",
    "- **_Non-Text formats_** such as Word, Excel or PowerPoint documents should be avoided.  These tend to change each time they are opened even if the core text does not change. it is better to use an alternative text example. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Note:_** one exception to the above rules are image files (ex jpg or png) that are used to help markdown or in the documentation.  It is typically okay to include these since they tend to get included only once and do not change much as the project evolves. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ```.gitignore``` (typically read \"dot git ignore\") is aa text file that contains a list of regular expressions (we will learn more about these later) that specify names of files we do not want to include in a git repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### .gitignore file\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```.gitignore``` (read \"dot git ignore\") file is used to help keep unwanted files out of your project.  Each line ```.gitignore``` file are filenames you want git to ignore.  For example, based on what we said above, a  good place to start on your ```.gitignore``` file would be the following two lines:\n",
    "```\n",
    ".ipynbcheckpoint\n",
    "__pychache__\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What should go into a .gitignore depends a lot on the type of project.  However, you don't need to invent these from scratch. For example, you could just copy the .gitignore file from the course repository or find one on the internet.  If you are using github I think it can also automatically create a .gitignore file for you if you specify your project as a python project. "

Although all modern computer's have ways to accept names with spaces do not use them.  Instead use underscores (\\_) or ```CamleCase``` (No spaces and capital letters at the beginning of each word in the name).  Avoiding spaces in your names will **_ALWAYS_** save time in the long run.  "

    "\n",
    "In your code there are two basic ways to determine the location of a folder inside your computer; Relative Paths and Absolute Paths.  A relative path is a path starting from your current directory and an absolute path is is a path starting from your computer's \"root\" directory.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Relative paths typically start with a single dot (.), representing the currecnt directory, or two double dots (..) representing the current directories parent folder.\n",
    "- Absolute paths typically start at the global root directory (/) on a Linux or Mac machine or with a drive label (ex C:) on a windows machine.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**_ALWAYS_** use relative paths in your git repository.  This ensures that others will be able to use your software if they download it onto their computer.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Good: ./data/  or ../data/ is a relative path to a child directory or sibling directory called data. \n",
    "    Bad (not acceptable): C:/research/data or /mnt/home/data are absolute paths to a data directory\n",

    "\n",
    "Turns out that Jupyter notebook files and git repositories work very poorly together.  Jupyter notebook files are a unique combination of source and program generated information.  So, everytime you run a jupyter file it can add output cells which make git think you you changed something important. In many cases it is just a few numbers or some output text.  When you run the ```git status``` command it always looks like jupyter notebook files have changed even when they have not changed. \n",

    "A good rule of thumb is to clear all of the output files before committing any changes to jupyter notebook files.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Open the jupyter notebook file\n",

    "- Save the notebook file.\n",
